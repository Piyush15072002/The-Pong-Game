There are 5 files of the project.

- `PongGame.py` is the main file of the project which has the game loop
- `ball.py` contains the ball physics like creation, bouncing, hitting, etc.
- `score.py` tracks the score of Player A and Player B
- `paddle.py` makes the bats or paddles for both players
- `decorateField` decorates the field to make it a bit attractive. This is an optional file and you can change the field settings like you wish.
